# ðŸ’Š Drug Interaction Explainer
This is a Streamlit-based application that simplifies complex medical **drug interaction descriptions** into easy-to-understand language using a fine-tuned T5 model

## ðŸ§  Key Features
- Simplifies drug interaction descriptions
- Easy-to-use Streamlit UI
- Supports custom text input
- Future-ready for UMLS and T5 model integration

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Main Streamlit app
â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Folder containing input CSV files
â”œâ”€â”€ ./T5_simplifier_model #folder containing the fine-tuned model
Note: The T5 model directory (`t5_simplifier_model/`) has been removed from GitHub due to file size limits. See below for model instructions.
To use the full functionality:
Download the model from Google Drive / Hugging Face 

Place it inside the root project folder like this:
DDI_simplifier/
â”œâ”€â”€ t5_simplifier_model/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pytorch_model.bin
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tokenizer_config.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...

The fine-tuned .csv is created manually using UMLS and online LLM models, it is contained in the data folder.

## ðŸš€ Run the App

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and Streamlit installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run app.py
